Some of these are probably repetitive and can be found in a style guide, but here goes nothing.

0. In title case, capitalize the second word in hyphenated words: https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.html

1. Eg and Ie are written as "e.g., " and "i.e., " because they are abbreviations for "for example" and "that is".

2. Use which or that appropriately depending on whether the clause is restrictive (that) or non-restrictive (which).
Technically, which can also be used restrictively, but that's too confusing.

3. Ranges, e.g., 1 to 10 are typeset using an en-dash: --
   Parenthetical statements are typeset using an em-dash: ---
   Compound adjectives are typeset using a hyphen: -

4. Hyphenate compound adjectives when in doubt as to how they may be parsed.

5. When in doubt, consult a style guide, e.g, The Chicago Manual of Style.

6. Footnotes should not break pronunciations.

7. et al is "et al."

8. versus is "vs."

9. Resist the em-dash unless there's a compelling need for it.

10. Contractions aren't good form in written text.

11. Anthropomorphisms aren't allowed either, although the lack of anthropomorphisms leads to very verbose text. 

12. Avoid participles and complex tenses (past continuous, past perfect, etc.). Prefer simple present, simple past, and simple future.
This is my own preference, but it has considerably simplified life for me.

13. its: the possessive of it
    it's: a contraction of "it is"
    
14. Capitalization of department names, etc.: https://wmich.edu/writing/rules/capitalization

15. The past tense of lead is led.

16. Use title case or sentence case consistently for section, subsection, and paragraph headings.
