Some of these are probably repetitive and can be found in a style guide, but here goes nothing.

1. Eg and Ie are written as "e.g., " and "i.e., " because they are abbreviations for "for example" and "that is".

2. Use which or that appropriately depending on whether the clause is restrictive (that) or non-restrictive (which).
Technically, which can also be used restrictively, but that's too confusing.

3. Ranges, e.g., 1 to 10 are typeset using an en-dash: --
   Parenthetical statements are typeset using an em-dash: ---
   Compound adjectives are typeset using a hyphen: -

4. Hyphenate compound adjectives when in doubt as to how they may be parsed.

5. When in doubt, consult a style guide, e.g, The Chicago Manual of Style.

6. Footnotes should not break pronunciations.

7. et al is "et al."

8. versus is "vs."

9. Resist the em-dash unless there's a compelling need for it.

10. Contractions aren't good form in written text.

11. Anthropomorphisms aren't allowed either, although the lack of anthropomorphisms leads to very verbose text.
