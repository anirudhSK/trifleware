1. Check that underscores in citations are rendered as underscores and not as subscript in Latex math mode.

2. Ensure all URLs referenced in the citations are actually accessible (you should not get a 404 not found).

3. Ensure the paper cites the correct citation at each location.

4. Ensure there are no duplicate citations.

5. Ensure citations are all in title case. You can do this by enclosing paper names in double braces instead of single braces.
