1. Use large fonts, typically just render it in a projector and check.

2. Ensure good contrast.
   --- White on black is good.
   --- Red on black isn't good.
   --- White on blue is good, but black on blue isn't great.

Again, render it on a projector and check.

3. Use version control for ppts as well. Even if they are binaries, it allows you to roll back and make changes securely.

4. Use standard fonts, e.g., Gadugi seems restricted to Windows, while Sans Serif, Times New Roman, and Verdana seem to work on Mac as well.

5. Either use title case or sentence case, but be consistent.

6. Don't introduce too many terms of art---and be consistent about the ones you do introduce.

7. For a one hour talk, practice for around 45 minutes without interruption.
