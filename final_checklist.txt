1. Widows and orphans.
2. You should have sections, subsections, and \noindent paragraphs that end with a period and run on.
3. Figures should be in order and appear close to the text (same page preferably or the immediate next one).
4. Consistent rules for et al (preferably don't use et al at all).
5. References must be sorted.
6. Font size on figures should be readable.
7. Print and check contrast.
8. Keep figures on top.
9. Keep a sparse bibliography, i.e., don't mention conference location etc.
10. Use \small or higher for bibliography.
11. Use title case for bibliography. Technically this is part of the bib format, but most bibs don't seem to handle url citations well. So, I think title case is a good choice for everything.
12. Add \pagebreak (not \newpage) to fix orphans if required. Don't use widowpenalty because that's too draconian.
13. Avoid vspace.
14. Cite only things you completely understand.
