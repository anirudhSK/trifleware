There is a set of errors that almost everybody is making in their text and
bibliographies. (If this doesn't apply to you, then you probably don't have
a bibliography, or you are aren't using Latex!)

* [LaTeX] Proper names in reference titles need protecting from Bibtex.
Use {curly braces} around them, or Bibtex will map them all to lower case.

* Make sure abbreviations are consistent (e.g., is NSDI spelled out or
not?) - using the @abbrev function in latex helps here.

* Make sure there is enough info for a reader to find the document: authors
plus title isn't enough.

* Don't blindly copy and paste ACM bibtex entries without fixing them:
  - they list "New York, NY" as the address field, which means that all ACM
conferences look like they took place there; just delete this, or - better
- replace it with where the conference took place, which is much more
helpful to the reader than the publisher's address
  - they have a truly weird idea about how to capitalize conference names;
just correct this (consistently)
* IEEE is about as bad, and uses a partially-inverted form of conference
names.
* Please actually read the bibliography before submitting your paper!


And while you are at it, please:

* [LaTeX] add \include{mathpmtc} in the main LaTeX file, so you don't have
math stuff in a different font than the main text
* don't put SI units in italics
* do differentiate between bits (b) and bytes (B), and between powers of 10
(MB) and 2 (MiB).
